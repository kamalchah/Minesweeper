# Minesweeper
 
This is a 10x10 minesweeper python emulator that I made in my intro to programming 1.
I enjoyed making this project because it helped me learn the basics of python functions and I believe some recursion.
The biggest obstacle I encountered during this project was handling the indexing of blocks out of bounds and a load of
NullPointerException errors.

To run, just run the python file and play using the python interpreter using rows and columns as index's.
